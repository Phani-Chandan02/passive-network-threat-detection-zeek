# 🚨 Passive Network Threat Detection & SOC Analytics using Zeek

## 🔍 Overview

This project presents a **real-time Security Operations Center (SOC) analytics system** built on top of Zeek network logs. It combines **machine learning–based anomaly detection** with **multi-log correlation** to identify suspicious network behavior in both offline (PCAP) and live monitoring scenarios.

The system is designed to simulate a **lightweight SOC pipeline**, capable of detecting threats such as DNS anomalies, suspicious traffic patterns, and correlated multi-log events — all visualized through an interactive dashboard.

## ⚡ Key Features

* 🧠 **DNS Anomaly Detection**
  Uses Isolation Forest to detect abnormal DNS query patterns.

* 🔗 **Multi-Log Fusion Engine**
  Correlates logs (conn, dns, ntp, etc.) for higher-confidence alerts.

* 📡 **Real-Time Monitoring**
  Watches Zeek logs continuously and updates alerts dynamically.

* 📊 **SOC Dashboard (Streamlit)**
  Visual interface for monitoring anomalies and alerts.

* 📁 **Offline PCAP Analysis**
  Generate logs from PCAP files and run full pipeline.

* ⚙️ **Modular Pipeline**
  Clean separation of feature engineering, detection, and reporting.

## 🧠 Detection Approach

### 1. Feature Engineering

* DNS query frequency
* Domain length
* Entropy of queries
* Request patterns

### 2. ML Model

* Isolation Forest (unsupervised anomaly detection)

### 3. Fusion Engine

* Combines multiple logs for context-aware detection
* Reduces false positives

---
